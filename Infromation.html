   p>KSI & Randolph have been making waves in the music scene since their first collaboration in 2011. 
   Now the two YouTube superstars take to the stage to perform new music and iconic hits at venues across the UK and Europe.</p> 

   <p>After closing out VidCon London with a live performance, YouTube megastar and seasoned boxer Olajide ‘KSI’ Olatunji is hitting 
        the road in furtherance of his music career. Olatunji and frequent collaborator (and fellow YouTuber Randolph) will embark on the New Age Tour 
        across the U.K. and Europe later this year. The tour will feature special guests at various stops, and the duo will perform both new and old hits, 
        according to a release, including “Lamborghini” — which has amassed more than 100 million YouTube views to date.</p>

   <p>Some of the main locations for the UK tour include:</p>
   
<p>17th May – Bournemouth</p>
<p>18th May – Portsmouth</p>
<p>19th May – Cardiff</p>
<p>23rd May Birmingham</p>    
<p>24th May- Liverpool</p>
<p>29th May – Glasgow</p>
<p>30th May – Newcastle</p>

<p>Some of the European Tour Date include:</p>

<p>26th June – Stockholm</p>
<p>28th June – Copenhagen</p>
<p>30th June – Amsterdam</p>
<p>7th July – Berlin</p>
<p>More tour dates are to be expected to be announced later this year for a US tour.</p>
